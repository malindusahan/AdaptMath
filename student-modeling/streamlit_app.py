    The Meta-Agent operates between sessions, not during them. The pipeline is:

    1. **Concept extractor** — LLM (Gemini) reads transcript, outputs structured `(skill, correct)` attempts
    2. **Knowledge graph** — SQLite-backed per-student concept map
    3. **BKT inference** — pure-Python implementation, computes calibrated mastery probabilities
    4. **Regression detector** — flags concepts whose mastery has dropped meaningfully
    5. **Learning path generator** — produces revise / learn next / already strong categories

    All five components are exposed via REST API endpoints and through this dashboard.
